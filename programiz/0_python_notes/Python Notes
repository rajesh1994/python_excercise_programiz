Python Notes:

1. Define Argument in Python?
    An argument is nothing more than a value that has been provided to a function, which is relayed when you call it.
    
2. Define open() function in Python?
    The open() function is used to open files in our system, the filename is the
name of the file to be opened. 

    The mode indicates, how the file is going to be opened "r" for reading,
"w" for writing and "a" for a appending. 

    The open function takes two arguments, the name of the file and and the mode
for which we would like to open the file. 

    By default, when only the filename is passed, the open function opens the file
in read mode.

3. Define read() function in Python?
    The read functions contains different methods, read(),readline() and readlines()

    read()		    -   return one big string

    readline()	    -   return one line at a time

    readlines()     -   returns a list of lines

4. Define write() function in Python?
    This method writes a sequence of strings to the file.

    write()	        -   Used to write a fixed sequence of characters to a file

    writelines()	-   writelines can write a list of strings.

5. Define append() function in Python?
    The append function is used to append to the file instead of overwriting it.

    To append to an existing file, simply open the file in append mode ("a"):

6. Define close() function in Python?
    When youâ€™re done with a file, use close() to close it and free up any system resources taken up by the open file

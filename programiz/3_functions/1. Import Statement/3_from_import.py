# Python from...import statement
"""
We can import specific names from a module without importing the module as a whole. Here is an example.
"""

from math import pi

print "*" * 145
print " " * 50, "1. Python from...import statement"
print "The value of pi is ", pi
print "*" * 145

"""
    We imported only the attribute pi from the module.

    In such case we don't use the dot operator.

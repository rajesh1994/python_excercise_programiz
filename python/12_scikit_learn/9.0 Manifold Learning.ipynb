    "### In-Depth: Manifold Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "• We have seen how principal component analysis (PCA) can be used in the dimensionality reduction task—reducing the number of features of a dataset while maintaining the essential relationships between the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "• While PCA is flexible, fast, and easily interpretable, it does not perform so well when there are nonlinear relationships within the data; we will see some examples of these below.\n",
    "\n",
    "• To address this deficiency, we can turn to a class of methods known as manifold learning—a class of unsupervised estimators that seeks to describe datasets as low-dimensional manifolds embedded in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "• When you think of a manifold, I'd suggest imagining a sheet of paper: this is a two-dimensional object that lives in our familiar three-dimensional world, and can be bent or rolled in that two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "• In the parlance of manifold learning, we can think of this sheet as a two-dimensional manifold embedded in three-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Rotating, re-orienting, or stretching the piece of paper in three-dimensional space doesn't change the flat geometry of the paper: such operations are akin to linear embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "• If you bend, curl, or crumple the paper, it is still a two-dimensional manifold, but the embedding into the three-dimensional space is no longer linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Manifold learning algorithms would seek to learn about the fundamental two-dimensional nature of the paper, even as it is contorted to fill the three-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Here we will demonstrate a number of manifold methods, going most deeply into a couple techniques: multidimensional scaling (MDS), locally linear embedding (LLE), and isometric mapping (IsoMap).\n",

    "• We begin with the standard imports:"

    "### In-Depth: Kernel Density Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "• In the previous section we covered Gaussian mixture models (GMM), which are a kind of hybrid between a clustering estimator and a density estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Recall that a density estimator is an algorithm which takes a D-dimensional dataset and produces an estimate of the D-dimensional probability distribution which that data is drawn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The GMM algorithm accomplishes this by representing the density as a weighted sum of Gaussian distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "• Kernel density estimation (KDE) is in some senses an algorithm which takes the mixture-of-Gaussians idea to its logical extreme: it uses a mixture consisting of one Gaussian component per point, resulting in an essentially non-parametric estimator of density. In this section, we will explore the motivation and uses of KDE.\n",

    "### Motivating KDE: Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "• As already discussed, a density estimator is an algorithm which seeks to model the probability distribution that generated a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "• For one dimensional data, you are probably already familiar with one simple density estimator: the histogram. A histogram divides the data into discrete bins, counts the number of points that fall in each bin, and then visualizes the results in an intuitive manner.\n",

    "• Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem.\n",

    "• It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other."

   "source": [
    "• The dataset is divided into two parts, namely, feature matrix and the response vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Feature matrix contains all the vectors(rows) of dataset in which each vector consists of the value of dependent features. In above dataset, features are ‘Outlook’, ‘Temperature’, ‘Humidity’ and ‘Windy’.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Response vector contains the value of class variable(prediction or output) for each row of feature matrix. In above dataset, the class variable name is ‘Play golf’."

    "\n",
    "    • We assume that no pair of features are dependent. For example, the temperature being ‘Hot’ has nothing to do with the humidity or the outlook being ‘Rainy’ has no effect on the winds. Hence, the features are assumed to be independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Secondly, each feature is given the same weight(or importance). For example, knowing only temperature and humidity alone can’t predict the outcome accurately. None of the attributes is irrelevant and assumed to be contributing equally to the outcome."

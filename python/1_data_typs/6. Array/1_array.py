"""
    Arrays are fundamental part of most programming languages. It is the collection of elements of a single data type, eg. array of int, array of string.

    However, in Python, there is no native array data structure. So, we use Python lists instead of an array.

    Note: If you want to create real arrays in Python, you need to use NumPy's array data structure. For mathematical problems, NumPy Array is more efficient.

    Unlike arrays, a single list can store elements of any data type and does everything an array does. We can store an integer, a float and a string inside the same list. So, it is more flexible to work with.

    [10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ] is an example of what an array would look like in Python, but it is actually a list.

Create an Array

    We can create a Python array with comma separated elements between square brackets[].

Pandas:

Pandas is a popular Python package for data science, and with good reason: it offers powerful, expressive and flexible data structures that make data manipulation and analysis easy, among many other things. The DataFrame is one of these structures.

Python | Pandas DataFrame:

	Pandas DataFrame is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).
	A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.
	Pandas DataFrame consists of three principal components, the data, rows, and columns.
	
Firstly, the DataFrame can contain data that is:
	a Pandas DataFrame
	
	a Pandas Series: a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type with axis labels or index. An example of a Series object is one column from a DataFrame.
	
	a NumPy ndarray, which can be a record or structured
	
	a two-dimensional ndarray
	
	dictionaries of one-dimensional ndarrayâ€™s, lists, dictionaries or Series.

    "• As a more involved example of working with some time series data, let’s take a look at bicycle counts on Seattle’s Fremont Bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "• This data comes from an automated bicycle counter, installed in late 2012, which has inductive sensors on the east and west sidewalks of the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Once this dataset is downloaded, we can use Pandas to read the CSV output into a DataFrame.\n",

    "• We will specify that we want the Date as an index, and we want these dates to be automatically parsed:"

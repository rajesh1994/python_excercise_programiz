The Pandas Series Object:
	A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. It can be created from a list or array.
	A Series is an analog of a one-dimensional array with flexible indices.
	While the NumPy array has an implicitly defined integer index used to access the values, the Pandas Series has an explicitly defined index associated with the values.
	This explicit index definition gives the Series object additional capabilities. For example, the index need not be an integer, but can consist of values of any desired type.

The Pandas DataFrame Object:
	If a Series is an analog of a one-dimensional array with flexible indices, a DataFrame is an analog of a two-dimensional array with both flexible row indices and flexible column names.
	
Indexers: loc, iloc, and ix:
	The loc attribute allows indexing and slicing that always references the explicit index.
	The loc for label based indexing.
	
	The iloc attribute allows indexing and slicing that always references the implicit Python-style index.\
	The loc for label based indexing.
	
	A third indexing attribute, ix , is a hybrid of the two, and for Series objects is equiva‚Äêlent to standard [] -based indexing.

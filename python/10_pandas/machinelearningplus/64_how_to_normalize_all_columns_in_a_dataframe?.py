Problem Statement : 64. How to normalize all columns in a dataframe?
"""

"""
1. Normalize all columns of df by subtracting the column mean and divide by standard deviation.

2. Range all columns of df such that the minimum value in each column is 0 and max is 1.

3. Donâ€™t use external packages like sklearn.
